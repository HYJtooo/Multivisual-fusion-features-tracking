# Multivisual-fusion-features-tracking
Multi-target pedestrian tracking in dense scenes based on fusion feature correlation under multi-vision
Under multi-vision, feature extraction and correlation are carried out based on the similarity of pedestrian features, and multi-target pedestrian tracking in dense pedestrian scene is completed through GMM-based feature pool update, pedestrian addition and recurrence judgment and other supplementary verification operations.
